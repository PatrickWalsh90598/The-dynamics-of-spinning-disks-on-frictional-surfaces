# The dynamics of spinning disks on frictional surfaces.

This repository contains a full report of the project to 
model the motion of the spinning disk as well as all of 
the code used and data obtained.

A note on naming convention: Many of the images are saved 
under names including a series of numbers such as
(50v0.001,0,0,0,0,80). This naming convention indicates
respectively, the initial values of Theta, Psi, Phi, 
dTheta/dt, dPsi/dt and dPhi/dt (separated by commas). The 
'v0.001' indicates which of these initial angles was varied 
slightly and by how much (generally they were varied by 0.001).

In the images saved under "Drag Coefficients" the naming 
convention is of the form (C_x, C_y, C_z) for example 
(0.1,0.1,0.1)
