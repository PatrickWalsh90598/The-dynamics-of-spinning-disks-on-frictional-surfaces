# The dynamics of spinning disks on frictional surfaces.

Ian Clancy

This repository contains a full report of the project to 
model the motion of the spinning disk as well as all of 
the code used and data obtained.

A note on naming convention: Many of the images are saved 
under names including a series of numbers such as
(50v0.001,0,0,0,0,80). This naming convention indicates
respectively, the initial values of Theta, Psi, Phi, 
dTheta/dt, dPsi/dt and dPhi/dt (separated by commas). The 
'v0.001' indicates which of these initial angles was varied 
slightly and by how much (generally they were varied by 0.001).
